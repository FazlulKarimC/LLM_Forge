# Dockerfile for Hugging Face Spaces Deployment
#
# NOTE: This file is used by the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
# It is written from the perspective that it lives at the ROOT of
# what is pushed to HF Spaces (alongside app/, alembic/, requirements.txt etc.)
# so all COPY paths are flat — no "backend/" prefix.

FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install system build tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies first (layer-cached unless requirements change)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the backend source code
COPY . .

# HF Spaces default port

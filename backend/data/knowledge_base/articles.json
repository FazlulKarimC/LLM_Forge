Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis. The general equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2.

        "text": "Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia), Tesla moved to the United States in 1884. He worked for Thomas Edison before striking out on his own. Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electrical power systems. He also developed the Tesla coil, a resonant transformer circuit. Tesla died on January 7, 1943, in New York City."

        "title": "Penicillin",
        "text": "Penicillin is a group of antibiotics derived from Penicillium fungi. The discovery of penicillin is attributed to Scottish physician Alexander Fleming, who noticed in 1928 that a Penicillium mould had contaminated a Petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria, and that the mould's presence prevented the bacteria from growing. Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain developed penicillin further for clinical use, and all three shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Penicillin became the first widely used antibiotic and saved millions of lives during World War II. It marked the beginning of the antibiotic era of medicine."

        "text": "The Himalayas is a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has many of Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest, at the border between Nepal and Tibet. The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding 7,200 m in elevation, including ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks. The range spans five countries: Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. The word 'Himalaya' means 'abode of snow' in Sanskrit."

        "title": "Fibonacci Sequence",
        "text": "The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. The sequence was introduced to Western European mathematics by Leonardo of Pisa (known as Fibonacci) in his 1202 book Liber Abaci. In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence defined by the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with seed values F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio (approximately 1.618). Fibonacci numbers appear in many areas of nature, such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and spiral patterns in sunflowers."

        "text": "Genghis Khan, born Temüjin, was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous land empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the empire and being proclaimed Genghis Khan in 1206, he launched the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. Born around 1162, he died in August 1227. The Mongol Empire eventually stretched from eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan. Genghis Khan promoted religious tolerance, trade along the Silk Road, and meritocracy within his empire."
